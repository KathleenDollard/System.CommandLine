# JackFruit

JackFruit started out as a way to do hiearchically nested types. 

This iteration also attacks a different question - what is an app model for System.CommandLine and how do you build one? And how many might there be?

This is currently a very imperfect point in time, that probably doesn't even run. But it's code that shows the idea.
